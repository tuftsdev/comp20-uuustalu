* The purpose of this *amazing* GIT repository is to facilitate my learning and advancement in COMP20.

* It is honestly very difficult to choose my favorite lab/assignment because I really did enjoy all of them.  However, I *absolutely loved* the whole Black Car Service theme we had going on this semester (Assignments 2-4). If I had to pick a favorite out of those, I would probably go with Assignment 3, because it was very challenging and I believe I learned the most from it.

* I have grown *extremely* much. On day 1 of this course I was a completely different person. Now I know how to build a fully functioning web application with both a server-side and a client-side and I even know how to assess and improve its security. I strongly believe that is a vital skill for any person in today's modern online world. And most importantly, next time I google something, I actually know what makes the magic happen.

* *Never-ever-ever trust user input! Never-ever-ever trust user input! Never-ever-ever trust user input!* Why? Two reasons:  
  - Most users are stupid. Stupid input can break your application.
  - Some users are not stupid. They are smart. A little too smart. They might use your gullibility against you.


* I also found Assignment 4 and the whole issue of security very *fascinating*. I would love the explore this field more deeply and take COMP 116 at some point.
